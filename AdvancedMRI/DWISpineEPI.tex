\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Spinal cord diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can diagnose disorders from fiber tract damage
	\item Several challenges:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Magnetic field inhomogeneities around spine create off-resonance artifacts
		\item Partial volume effects from CSF and lipid
		\item Spinal cord cross section very small
		\item Bulk physiologic motion from heart, breathing, swallowing, CSF pulsation
	\end{itemize}
	\item Result is low-signal, low-resolution DW images with artifacts in spinal cord
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) most frequently used technique for DWI
	\begin {itemize}
		\item Acquires whole k-space after single excitation pulse
		\item No ghosting artifacts from motion-induced phase errors
	\end {itemize}
	\item Long readout experiences $T_2^*$ decay
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Spinal cord imaging benefits from reduced FOV applications
	\item Reduced FOV methods decrease the readout duration and reduce off-resonance artifacts
	\item Excited FOV in PE direction reduced by 2D spatially selective echo-planar RF excitation pulse and $180^{\circ}$ refocusing RF pulse
	\item Allows multi slice imaging and suppresses fat signal
\end{itemize}
